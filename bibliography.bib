abstract = {Internet-wide network scanning has numerous security applications, including exposing new vulnerabilities and tracking the adoption of defensive mechanisms, but prob- ing the entire public address space with existing tools is both difficult and slow. We introduce ZMap, a modular, open-source network scanner specifically architected to perform Internet-wide scans and capable of surveying the entire IPv4 address space in under 45 minutes from user space on a single machine, approaching the theo- retical maximum speed of gigabit Ethernet. We present the scanner architecture, experimentally characterize its performance and accuracy, and explore the security impli- cations of high speed Internet-scale network surveys, both offensive and defensive. We also discuss best practices for good Internet citizenship when performing Internet-wide surveys, informed by our own experiences conducting a long-term research survey over the past year. 1},

abstract = {Because robots can directly perceive and affect the physical world, security issues take on particular importance. In this paper, we describe the results of our work on scanning the entire IPv4 address space of the Internet for instances of the Robot Operating System (ROS), a widely used robotics platform for research. Our results identified that a number of hosts supporting ROS are exposed to the public Internet, thereby allowing anyone to access robotic sensors and actuators. As a proof of concept, and with consent, we were able to read image sensor information and move the robot of a research group in a US university. This paper gives an overview of our findings, including the geographic distribution of publicly-accessible platforms, the sorts of sensor and actuator data that is available, as well as the different kinds of robots and sensors that our scan uncovered. Additionally, we offer recommendations on best practices to mitigate these security issues in the future.},

abstract = "In this work we examine the feasibility of quantitatively characterizing some aspects of security. In particular, we investigate if it is possible to predict the number of vulnerabilities that can potentially be present in a software system but may not have been found yet. We use several major operating systems as representatives of complex software systems. The data on vulnerabilities discovered in these systems are analyzed. We examine the results to determine if the density of vulnerabilities in a program is a useful measure. We also address the question about what fraction of software defects are security related, i.e., are vulnerabilities. We examine the dynamics of vulnerability discovery hypothesizing that it may lead us to an estimate of the magnitude of the undiscovered vulnerabilities still present in the system. We consider the vulnerability discovery rate to see if models can be developed to project future trends. Finally, we use the data for both commercial and open-source systems to determine whether the key observations are generally applicable. Our results indicate that the values of vulnerability densities fall within a range of values, just like the commonly used measure of defect density for general defects. Our examination also reveals that it is possible to model the vulnerability discovery using a logistic model that can sometimes be approximated by a linear model."

The security-sensitive nature of these tasks, such as the understanding of malware or the decryption of encrypted content, brings unique challenges to reverse engineering: work has to be done offline, files can rarely be shared, time pressure is immense, and there is a lack of tool and process support for capturing and sharing the knowledge obtained while trying to understand plain assembly code. To help us gain an understanding of this reverse engineering work, we report on an exploratory study done in a security context at a research and development government organization to explore their work processes, tools, and artifacts. In this paper, we identify challenges, such as the management and navigation of a myriad of artifacts, and we conclude by offering suggestions for tool and process improvements.},

By using a mix of real and dummy contacts, one can camouflage a standard cell whose functionality can be one of many. If an attacker cannot resolve the functionality of a camouflaged gate, he/she will extract an incorrect netlist. In this paper, we analyze the feasibility of identifying the functionality of camouflaged gates. We also propose techniques to make the dummy contact-based IC camouflaging technique resilient to reverse engineering. Furthermore, we judiciously select gates to camouflage by using techniques which ensure that the outputs of the extracted netlist are controllably corrupted. The techniques leverage IC testing principles such as justification and sensitization. The proposed techniques are evaluated using ISCAS benchmark circuits and OpenSparc T1 microprocessor controllers.},

	doi = {10.1109/WF-IoT.2016.7845429},
	abstract = {With the rapid technological advancements of sensors, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have become a popular technology for the Internet of Things (IoT). We investigated the security of WSNs in an environmental monitoring application with the goal to demonstrate the overall security. We implemented a Secure Temperature Monitoring System (STMS), which served as our WSN application. Our results revealed a security flaw found in the bootstrap loader (BSL) password used to protect MSP430 micro-controller units (MCUs). We demonstrated how the BSL password could be brute forced in a matter of days. Furthermore, we illustrate how an attacker can reverse engineer WSN applications to obtain critical security information such as encryption keys. We contribute a solution to patch the weak BSL password security flaw and improve the security of MSP430 MCU chips. The Secure-BSL patch we contribute allows the randomization of the BSL password. Our solution increases the brute force time to decades. The impractical brute force time enhances the security of the MSP430 and prevents future reverse engineering tactics. Our research serves as proof that the security of WSNs and the overall IoT technology is broken if we cannot protect these everyday objects at the physical layer.},

	title = {Automatic reverse engineering of data structures from binary execution},
	abstract = {With only the binary executable of a program, it is useful to discover the program's data structures and infer their syntactic and semantic definitions. Such knowledge is highly valuable in a variety of security and forensic applications. Although there exist efforts in program data structure inference, the existing solutions are not suitable for our targeted application scenarios. In this paper, we propose a reverse engineering technique to automatically reveal program data structures from binaries. Our technique, called REWARDS, is based on dynamic analysis. More specifically, each memory location accessed by the program is tagged with a timestamped type attribute. Following the program's runtime data flow, this attribute is propagated to other memory locations and registers that share the same type. During the propagation, a variable's type gets resolved if it is involved in a type-revealing execution point or type sink. More importantly, besides the forward type propagation, REWARDS involves a backward type resolution procedure where the types of some previously accessed variables get recursively resolved starting from a type sink. This procedure is constrained by the timestamps of relevant memory locations to disambiguate variables re-using the same memory location. In addition, REWARDS is able to reconstruct in-memory data structure layout based on the type information derived. We demonstrate that REWARDS provides unique benefits to two applications: memory image forensics and binary fuzzing for vulnerability discovery.},

	abstract = {Companies releasing newly designed embedded products typically recoup the cost of development through initial sales, and thus are unlikely to welcome early competition based around rapid reverse engineering of their products. By contrast, competitors able to shorten time-to-market though reverse engineering will gain design cost and market share advantages. Reverse engineering for nefarious purposes appears to be commonplace, and has significant cost impact on industry sales and profitability. In the Embedded Systems MSc programme at Nanyang Technological University, we are aiming to raise awareness of the unique security issues related to the reverse engineering of embedded systems. This effort is largely through devoting 50\% of the secure embedded systems course, ES6190 to reverse engineering (the remainder to traditional security concerns). This paper covers the reverse engineering problem scope, and our approach to raising awareness through the secure embedded systems course. A classification of hardware reverse engineering steps and mitigations is also presented for the first time, with an overview of a reverse engineering curriculum. Since the quantity of published literature related to the reverse-engineering of embedded systems lies somewhere between scarce and nonexistent, this paper presents a full overview of the topic before descussing educational aspects related to this.},

	abstract = {The specifications of an application's security configuration are crucial for understanding its security policies, which can be very helpful in security-related contexts such as misconfiguration detection. Such specifications, however, are often ill-documented, or even close because of the increasing use of graphic user interfaces to set program options. In this paper, we propose ConfigRE, a new technique for automatic reverse engineering of an application's access-control configurations. Our approach first partitions a configuration input into fields, and then identifies the semantic relations among these fields and the roles they play in enforcing an access control policy. Based upon such knowledge, ConfigRE automatically generates a specification language to describe the syntactic relations of these fields. The language can be converted into a scanner using standard parser generators for scanning configuration files and discovering the security policies specified in an application. We implemented ConfigRE in our research and evaluated it against real applications. The experiment results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.},

	abstract = {The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite is widely employed to interconnect computing facilities in today's network environments. However, there exist several security vulnerabilities in the TCP specification and additional weaknesses in a number of its implementations. These vulnerabilities may allow an intruder to "attack" TCP-based systems, enabling him/her to "hijack" a TCP connection or cause denial of service to legitimate users. The authors analyze the TCP code via a "reverse engineering" technique called "program slicing" to identify several of these vulnerabilities, especially those that are related to the TCP state-transition diagram. They discuss many of the flaws present in the TCP implementation of many widely used operating systems, such as SUNOS 4.1.3, SVR4, and ULTRIX 4.3. The corresponding TCP attack "signatures" (including the well-known 1994 Christmas Day Mitnick Attack) are described, and recommendations are provided to improve the security state of a TCP-based system (e.g., incorporation of a "timer escape route" from every TCP state). Also, it is anticipated that wide dissemination of this article's results may not only lead to vendor patches to TCP code to plug security holes, but also raise awareness of how program slicing may be used to analyze other networking software and how future designs of TCP and other software can be improved.},

abstract = "In this work we examine the feasibility of quantitatively characterizing some aspects of security. In particular, we investigate if it is possible to predict the number of vulnerabilities that can potentially be present in a software system but may not have been found yet. We use several major operating systems as representatives of complex software systems. The data on vulnerabilities discovered in these systems are analyzed. We examine the results to determine if the density of vulnerabilities in a program is a useful measure. We also address the question about what fraction of software defects are security related, i.e., are vulnerabilities. We examine the dynamics of vulnerability discovery hypothesizing that it may lead us to an estimate of the magnitude of the undiscovered vulnerabilities still present in the system. We consider the vulnerability discovery rate to see if models can be developed to project future trends. Finally, we use the data for both commercial and open-source systems to determine whether the key observations are generally applicable. Our results indicate that the values of vulnerability densities fall within a range of values, just like the commonly used measure of defect density for general defects. Our examination also reveals that it is possible to model the vulnerability discovery using a logistic model that can sometimes be approximated by a linear model."
