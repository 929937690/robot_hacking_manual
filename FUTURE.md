 *None for now*. Some pointers:
 - https://twitter.com/daeken/status/1025123319824244738. *Listing things below*

 - [ ] Read: Reversing by Eldad Eilam
 - [ ] Assembly
   - [ ] Do: Write some C, compile it,
   - [ ] disassemble, hand-decompile to C
   - [ ] Do: Have a friend write and compile some C,
   - [ ] then disassemble and hand-decompile it and have friend check your work
 - [ ] Do: Pick a game (some ideas in the CTF section, some hacking oriented games exist).  Reverse-engineer its archive format and write an unpacker
 - [ ] Read: The Dragon Book (Compilers by Aho et al)
 - [ ] Do: Write a compiler from some high-level language (feel free to make one up) to another (Python) 7)
 - [ ] Do: Write an assembler
 - [ ] Do: Write a compiler from some language down to assembly
   - [ ] C https://norasandler.com/2017/11/29/Write-a-Compiler.html
 - [ ] Read: Reverse Compilation Techniques by Cifuentes [...]
 - [ ] Do: Write a decompiler for CIL and/or Dalvik bytecode
 - [ ] Do: Write a decompiler for ARM (doesn't have to be ARM, but it's consistent and relatively sane)
 - [ ] Read: The osdev wiki, until your eyes can't focus anymore [...]
 - [ ] Do: Write a toy kernel
   - [ ] Do: Write it again, with slightly less suck
   - [ ] Do: Port your kernel to a different platform
 - [ ] Do: Pick a well-known platform and write an interpreting emulator
   - [ ] Do: Add a recompiler [...]
 - [ ] Do: Pick a slightly-unknown platform
   - [ ] Read: Everything you can find about it
   - [ ] Do: Begin writing an emulator
   - [ ] Read: All the assembly you can find, for bits that aren't known
   - [ ] Go back to 16b, continuing your work [...]
