**Note**: as in previous tutorials, there's a docker container that facilitates reproducing the work of this tutorial. The container can be built with:
```bash
docker build -t basic_cybersecurity_footprinting2:latest .
```
and runned with:
```bash
docker run --privileged -it basic_cybersecurity_footprinting2:latest
```
