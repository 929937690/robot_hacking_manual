### Robot hacks
A non-exhaustive list of cybersecurity research in robotics and various related robot hacks due to cybersecurity issues.

| üëπ Codename/theme | ü§ñ Robotics technology affected | üë®‚Äçüî¨ Researchers | üìñ Description | üìÖ Date |
|-----|-------|-------------|-------------|------|
| | Enabot's [`Ebo Air`](https://na.enabot.com/shop/air001) | Modux[^1] |  Researchers from Modux found a security *flaw* in Enabot Ebo Air #robot and responsibly disclosed their findings. Attack vectors could lead to remote-controlled *robot* spy units. Major entry point appears to be a hardcoded system administrator password that is weak and shared across all of these robots. Researchers also found information disclosure issues that could lead attackers to exfiltrate home (e.g. home WiFi password) that could then be used to pivot into other devices through local network. | 21-07-2022 |

Results hinted that DDS's security mechanisms are not secure and much more effort on this side is required to protect sensitive industrial and military systems powered by this communication middleware | 19-04-2022 |

| <ins>Robot Operating System (ROS): Safe & Insecure</ins>[^9] | ROS | [Lubomir Stroetmann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lubo-stroetmann/) (softSCheck) | This is one of the earliest studies touching on ROS and offers security insights and examples about the lack of security considerations in ROS and the wide attack surface exposed by it. The author hints that with ROS, protection mechanism depends on the (security) expertise of the user, which is not a good assumption in the yet security-immature robotics community. Moreover the author hints about various vulnerabilities that are easily exploitable due to the XMLRPC adoption within the ROS message-passing infrastructure including various XML bomb attacks (e.g. "billion laughs") | 28-02-2014 |
