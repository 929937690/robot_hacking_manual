# basic_cybersecurity
An introductory series of cybersecurity with comprehensive step-by-step tutorials.

#### Exploitation
An `exploit` is a piece of software, a chunk of data, or a sequence of commands that takes advantage of a bug or vulnerability to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur on computer software, hardware, or something electronic (usually computerized). Exploitation is the art of taking advantage of vulnerabilities.
