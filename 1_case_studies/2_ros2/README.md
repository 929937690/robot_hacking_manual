## Robot Operating System (ROS) 2

The Robot Operating System (ROS) is the de *facto* standard for robot application development [@Quigley09]. It's a framework for creating robot behaviors that comprises various stacks and capabilities for message passing, perception, navigation, manipulation or security, among others. It's [estimated](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190516005135/en/Rise-ROS-55-total-commercial-robots-shipped) that by 2024, 55% of the total commercial robots will be shipping at least one ROS package.
ROS is to roboticists what Linux is to computer scientists.

This case study will analyze the default security of ROS 2[^1] and evaluate a ROS 2 robot from a security standpoint, the TurtleBot 3.

[^1]: ROS 2 is the second edition of ROS targeting commercial solutions and including additional capabilities. ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is an open source software development kit for robotics  applications. The purpose of ROS 2 is to offer a standard software platform to developers across industries that will carry them from research and prototyping through to deployment and  production. ROS 2 builds on the success of ROS 1, which is used today in myriad robotics applications  around the world.
